Most Windows 95 setups are easy and trouble-free : however, any time
you update your computer's operating system, it is possible that an error
could occur (such as system failure due to incompatible hardware, or a
power failure) that may temporarily or permanently prevent access to
data .
Before you set up Windows 95, you might want to back up certain
system files . The files you should hack up include the following :

	
All initialization (ini) files in your Windows directory
 All registry data ( .dat) files in your Windows directory
 All password ( .pwl) files in your Windows directory
 Any files specified in the Config .sys and Autoexec .bat files
 Your Config .sys and Autoexec .bat files, located in the root directory
of your startup drive (usually drive C)

	
Proprietary network configuration files and logon scripts
You may also want to back up personal or business data that is on the
hard disk.
Just before setting up Windows 95, make sure your network software, if
any, is working . The settings from the existing network configuration are
used in Windows 95 .

extensions, look up extensions .
filename" in the Help Index
For information about mapping
drive letters,. see Using the
Network '"m Chapter 3, introducing
Networks, "
What is a path?
A path is a more direct way to describe where a file, such as a
document or program, is located on your computer or the network .
It lists the drive, such as the hard disk, floppy disk, CD-ROM
drive, or shared network folder, that contains the document . It also
lists all the folders that you need to open to find the document .
To specify the full path for a document, type the drive letter,
followed by a colon () and backslash (\) . Then list the folders in
the order you open them . If there are more than one, separate the
names by backslashes . Then type the filename .
Windows 95 supports long filenames, which can contain up to
250 characters . If you use long filenames, enclose the path in
quotation marks.
Here are some examples of paths :

	
To specify the location of the Readme file, which is located on
drive C in the Windows folder, you would type :
c :\windows\readme.txt
 To specify the location of a document named Party List .doc,
located in the Holiday folder, which is in the Social Events
folder on drive C, you would type :
"c:\social events\holiday\party list .doc"

	
To specify the location of a bitmap (drawing) named Canyon,
which is located on the network in a shared folder named
\\Pictures\Scenic , you could type :
\\pictures\scenic\canyon.bmp
Or, if the folder is mapped to drive D, you could type :
d :\canyon.bmp
Shutting Down Your Computer
You need to shut down Windows before you turn off or restart your
computer . That way you can be sure your work is saved to your hard
disk .
Caution To avoid damaging files, always shut down Windows before
you turn off your computer .
To quit Windows and shut down your computer
Click the Start button, and
then click Shut Down .
3 A screen message lets you know when
you can safely turn off your computer .
Chapter 1 The Basics

2 Click Yes . If you forget
to save changes to
documents, Windows
prompts you to save
changes .

Introducing Microsoft Windows 95
Using the Network
A network is a group of computers connected to each other or to a
central server so they can share resources such as documents and
printers .
Your connection to a network can change the way you work :

	
You can use programs and documents from another computer without
passing floppy disks back and forth .
 You can print documents on a printer attached to another computer,
or use another computer's fax modem, just as if they were connected
to your computer. 
	
You can gain access to the Internet .
 You may also be able to send and receive messages by using
electronic mail, or connect to your work computer from home .
Introducing the Network Neighborhood
If your computer is set up to use a network, the Network Neighborhood
icon appears on the desktop .
When you double-click Network Neighborhood, you might see the
computers in your workgroup or any NetWare servers you are connected
to . Generally, your workgroup has been set up by an administrator so
that the computers in it contain most of the resources you want to use .
You can see other computers on the network - those not in your
workgroup - by double-clicking the Entire Network icon, which
appears in Network Neighborhood .
If your computer is not set up to use a network, read the following
section .

Setting Up Your Computer to Use a Network
TIPS
You can also double-click
Network in Control Panel to
add or delete network
components and change
settings for components that
were previously installed .
You can connect to your office
computer and the network it is
on from your home or on the
road . For more information, see
"Using Dial-Up Networking" later
in this chapter .
There are two major steps in setting up a network : setting up your
hardware and setting up your software .
Note Your computer may already be set up to use a network . If
Windows prompts you for a network password at startup, and if the
Network Neighborhood icon appears on the Windows desktop, your
network is already set up and you can skip this section .
Before setting up the software, be sure your network hardware is
correctly installed . This includes the network adapter (network card
or other device) and cables .
To set up network software
Click the Start button,
point to Settings, and then
click Control Panel .

Introducing Microsoft Windows 95
What are the network components?

	
Client software enables you to connect to network resources
such as folders and printers that have been shared on
computers on the network.
With Client for NetWare Networks, you can connect to
Novell® NetWare® servers . With Client for Microsoft
Networks, you can use resources shared on computers
running Microsoft Windows 95, Windows for Workgroups,
Windows NT'", LAN Manager, and on other Microsoftcompatible
computers . 
	
A network adapter is an expansion card or other device that
physically connects your computer to the network . 
	
A protocol might be called the language your computer uses
when communicating over the network . Several protocols are
available . Two computers must use the same protocol to
communicate with each other.

	
Service software includes services such as file and printer
sharing for your computer or automatic backup to a network
server .
Identifying your computer on the network
After setting up network software, you need to give Windows some
information to identify your computer on the network . For example, your
network administrator may have assigned your computer to a workgroup
of computers . These are likely to contain most of the resources you will
want to use.
You identify your computer by using the procedure on the next page .
identify your computer o t network
In the Network dialog box, click the
Identification tab . v 2 Type a name for your computer, your workgroup name, and
a brief description of your system that other people will see
when they look at your computer on the network .

Sharing Your Folders or Printers
See Also
For information about installing file
and print sharing, lookup enabling
'file and printersharing' in the Help
Index
If you installed file and printer services for Microsoft Networks or
NetWare Networks, you can share your documents and any printers
attached to your computer with other people on the network . To share
documents, you share the folder they are in .
Giving permission to use your shared resources
There are two ways to grant people access to the folders and
printers you share over the network :

	
Share-level access control - Anyone wanting to use the shared
resource must know the password you have assigned to it . 
	
User-level access control - As you share a resource, you
specify the names of people or groups who are authorized to
use it . If you choose this type of access, you need to specify
the computer or domain where the list of authorized users is
located .
Windows automatically assigns a permission setting when you set
up to share resources . For information about choosing a different
type of permission, look up "access to your computer" in the Help
Index.

Play games
When you're not working, you can play games or customize the way
Windows looks . Here are only some of the fun things you can do .
Explore sound and animation
Windows provides many multimedia features . You can use CD Player to
play audio compact discs, Sound Recorder to play or record sounds, or
Media Player to view animations.
If you're looking for a fun challenge, try the games that come with
Windows - for example, Solitaire, one of the most popular card games
of all time .

Introducing Microsoft Windows 95
Maintaining Your System
Windows provides tools that you should use regularly to maintain your
hard disk. Look for these tools in the System Tools folder, which is
located in the Accessories folder .
Back up the information on your disk
Backing up your files safeguards them against loss if your hard disk fails
or you accidentally overwrite or delete data .
Check and repair your disk by using ScanDisk
ScanDisk can check the files and folders on your hard disk for data
errors, and it can also check the physical surface of the disk .
Optimizing Your Computer
Windows includes several features to improve your computer's
performance. Look for these tools in the System Tools folder, which
is located in the Accessories Folder .
Increase disk space by compressing data
You can free up space on hard and floppy disks by using DriveSpace
to compress the data that is on them . If your drive is uncompressed,
compressing it will generally give you 50 to 100 percent more free
space .
Defragment your disk
Over time, files can become divided into fragments that are stored in
different locations on your hard disk . These files are complete when you
open them, but it takes longer for your computer to read from and write
to them . To defragment your files and speed up performance, use Disk
Defragmenter.

Communicating with the World
Send and receive faxes
Windows provides several ways for you to communicate with
co-workers and friends and with the rest of the world .
Share information by using electronic mail
Microsoft Exchange features a universal Inbox where you can send
and receive electronic mail, and organize, access, and share all types of
information, including faxes and items from online services .
You can use Microsoft Fax to send and receive fax messages . All you
need is a fax modem you can access on a network or one attached to your
own computer . Incoming faxes appear as messages in your Microsoft
Exchange Inbox . Microsoft Fax comes with a Cover Page Editor
(including several sample cover pages) and a Fax Viewer for viewing
faxes that cannot be edited .
Connect to other computers
You can use HyperTerminal and a modem to connect to a remote
computer that is not running Windows . This enables you to easily
connect to bulletin boards, host systems, or text-based online services .
HyperTerminal even configures your modem for you and enables you
to dial automatically .
Explore the online world
Windows 95 also features access to a new online service : The Microsoft
Network. Using it, you can exchange messages with people around the
world; read the latest news, sports, weather, and financial information ;
find answers to your technical questions ; download from a collection of
thousands of useful programs ; connect to the Internet ; and more!

70 Introducing Microsoft Windows 95
Visual Glossary
This section explains some terms and basic actions you will encounter in
Microsoft Windows 95 and in the Windows documentation .
Using a mouse
A mouse or other pointing device works on the principle that first you
place your mouse pointer on (point to) something on your screen, and
then you click with a mouse button to perform an action on that item .
Note Windows documentation assumes you have a mouse and are righthanded;
if you are left-handed, you can switch left and right mouse
buttons. For information, look up "switching, mouse buttons" in the Help
Index . Also, if you use a pen device, a mouse "click" corresponds to a
pen "tap."
As you move your mouse on a flat surface, the pointer moves on your
screen . If you run out of room, pick up the mouse and place it in another
spot .
To point, move the mouse until the tip of the pointer is over the item or
area you want to point to . Then you can do the following :

	
Click
Action
	
Description
Click : Press and release the left mouse button once .
Double-click : Quickly press and release the left mouse
button twice .
Click with the right mouse button : Press and release the
right mouse button once . A shortcut menu appears .

To move an item to another location, first point to it . Press and hold
down the left or right mouse button, and point to where you want the
object ; then release the mouse button . You also drag to select text or
other information in a window . For more information, look up "drag
and drop" in the Help Index .
Using the taskbar
The taskbar, located at the bottom of your screen when you first start
Windows, contains the Start button . To move the taskbar to a different
edge of your screen, point to an empty part of the taskbar, and then drag
it to the location you want .
Using a dialog box
Windows displays a dialog box when you must supply information or
specify options or properties. For example, when you click the Open
command to open a document, a dialog box enables you to choose the
one you want. The following is an example of another dialog box .
7 2 Introducing Microsoft Windows 95
You can use the following types of options in dialog boxes and when you
work with the properties for an object :

Moving windows
Moving a window to a different place on the screen can make it easier
to see more than one window at a time or see something the window is
covering up .
To move a window, drag its title bar to a new location .
Selecting information
You select (highlight) text or other information before doing something
to it, such as making it appear bold or copying it to another part of your
document. To select, place the pointer where you want to begin selecting .
Then drag the pointer to where you want the selection to end .
Using toolbars
Toolbars appear in many programs and provide quick ways to do tasks .
Most toolbar buttons correspond to a menu command . You can find out
what each button does by resting your pointer over the button : A box
appears, displaying the button name .
